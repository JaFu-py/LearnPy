      In Python there are many different data types but the ones we are going to
      talk about now are the following:
    </p>

    <h4>Integer</h4>
    <p>
      In python integers are represented by the keyword "int". Int's are any
      whole number (negative or positive).
    </p>

    <h4>Float</h4>
    <p>
      In python floats are represented by the keyword "float". Floats's are any
      decimal number (negative or positive).
    </p>

    <h4>String</h4>
    <p>
      In python strings are represented by the keyword "str". Str's are any
      anything surrounded by double quotes ("im a string") or single quotes ('i
      am also a string').
    </p>

    <h4>Boolean</h4>
    <p>
      In python boolean's are represented by the keyword "bool". Bools are
      either True or False (Capitals Matter!).
    </p>

### Data Types

#### Objectives: 
* To familiarize students with the basic concepts of programming and the Python programming language.
* To understand and use basic data types, variables and operations in Python.
* To write simple programs in Python.
  
A "Data Type" is simply a classification of information. The data type of an object dictates the different things that we can do to it and use it for.

In Python there are many different data types but the ones we are going to talk about now are the following:

**__Integer__**: In python integers are represented by the keyword "int". Int's are any whole number (negative or positive).

**__Float__**: In python floats are represented by the keyword "float". Floats's are any decimal number (negative or positive).

**__String__**: In python strings are represented by the keyword "str". Str's are any anything surrounded by double quotes ("im a string") or single quotes ('i am also a string').

**__Boolean__**: In python boolean's are represented by the keyword "bool". Bools are either True or False (Capitals Matter!).

```py
1, 3, 5, 9, -3, 0 #  Integers
1.0, 0.9, -0.7, 5.6, 8.0 #  Floats (Decimals)
"hello", "0.2", '-98', 'True' #  Strings
True, False #  Boolean
```

#### Task 1: 
To create a variable, you use the = symbol.

```py
name = value
```
1) create a variable called "name" and give it a string value.
2) ok
